## Overview

- Since January 2024, I have been working on the "Legislative Mapping" project under the supervision of Prof. Suresh Venkatasubramanian at the [CNTR](https://cntr.brown.edu/). 
- Our goal is to build a scorecard to evaluate U.S. bills about AI and automated decision-making (ADS). Read our **[blog post](https://cntr.brown.edu/news/2025-03-12/cntr-aisle-framework)** here.
- We won the **Audience Favorite award** at the **2024 Brown CS Research Symposium**. Read our [poster](/cs-symposiump-poster.pdf) here:

## Our Progress

- Our team leads recently published an [overview](https://cntr.substack.com/p/seeking-harmony-in-ai-governance) of proposed AI legislation across all 50 states. We’ve identified 610 AI-related bills, and 114 bills that would regulate state governments’ use of AI. 
- We recently expanded our collaboration with [Plural Policy](https://pluralpolicy.com/blog/cntr-brown-plural/).
